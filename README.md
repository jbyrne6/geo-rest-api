# GEO REST API

## Problem:
Create a REST API, with a single resource, that accepts an HTTP POST method request with two GeoJSON polygon objects.
This should returns a Boolean value indicating whether the provided objects spatially intersect one another.

## Requirements:
- All requests and responses must be valid JSON
- The completed challenge must be pushed to GitHub (github.com) for review during onsite interview in a private repository (give access to me, please)
- Include relevant documentation for the running and testing of the application

- **Note:** Try and write the application in Python if possible and use open source libraries to your advantage!

- It's ok if you are unable to complete the challenge, but at minimum be prepared to discuss possible implementation steps during onsite interview.

## Guidance:
- This should take less than 4 hrs to complete (although, you can take up to a week to send back your solution)

- We're not looking for perfection, but rather a framework to hold a discussion about your thoughts on design, implementation, library selection, etc...

- If you're taking more time than expected: add skeleton code, comments, etc... to support that discussion.

## Libraries
- Flask
- ArcGIS
- Docker
